Introduction
======
The goal of this project consists in buiding a search engine over a data base of Airbnb houses.

The code returns the houses of the data base which matches the descriptions entered by an user query. User query means the sentence an user enter in a search field, for example: "A beuatiful house with beach and garden". 

This project is mostly related to text-mining, where some metrics and tools for computing text similarity score ranking were used.

Download sets of data

The data used are available on [Airbnb Property Data from Texas](https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/airbnb-property-data-from-texas). A dataset of 18,000+ properties.

With this data we have the necessary to run the analysis.
